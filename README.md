#  A cost efficient framework and algorithm for embedding dynamic virtual network requests
Matlab code implementation for the paper "cost efficient framework and algorithm for embedding dynamic virtual network requests"

# Project for CO463

This project is a matlab implementation of the paper "**cost efficient framework and algorithm for embedding dynamic virtual network requests**" which outputs various insights from the paper and visual analysis of the results.

The project compares 5 algorithms
 1. **DVNMA_NS** -> The approach proposed in this work for reconfiguring the evolved virtual network without any share strategy
 2. **DVNMA_SS** -> The approach proposed in this work for reconfiguring the evolved virtual network using the self share strategy while allocating bandwidth resources
 3. **DVNMA_SS** -> The approach proposed in this work for reconfiguring the evolved virtual network using the mixed share strategy while allocating bandwidth resources
 4. **Greedy** -> The extended algorithm in which the greedy strategy is used for greedily picking the substrate node having enough node resource tohost a virtual node
 5. **Static** -> The extended algorithm in which the random picking strategy is used for selecting substrate node to host a virtual node.

### Motivation
The given research paper provides an in depth analysis of algorithms for embedding dynamic virtual network request. Our matlab
implementation is inspired to give a working model providing visual insights that would help in better understanding of the paper, comparing 
5 algorithms used in the paper hence enabling a larger audience to refer this work.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
One can also use matlab online for the same.

## Prerequisites

### What things you need to install the software and how to install them

#### Following are the dependencies one has to install in their system
 ``` 
  - python 3.6.8 
  - python pip
  - matlab online / offline
  - matplotlib 3.4.0
 ```
#### After installing the above clone this repository and paste the folder in matlab environment.  
 
Using the matlab online one can upload all files of the folder ðŸ“‚.

## Run

#### After downloading all the dependencies run the following files:- 
   
    - Generate_requests.m 
    - find_total_requests.m
    - performance.m
    - comparing.m
    - progressbar.m
    - test_optimal_embedding.m

## Results

Output on running compare.m file, data is then visualised using matplotlib
